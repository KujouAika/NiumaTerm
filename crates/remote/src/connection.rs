//! A client's lasting connection to one paired host.
//!
//! Sessions belong to the host and survive network loss, so the client
//! keeps its views and reconnects under them: after a drop it backs off
//! from 0.5 s to 30 s with jitter, and on success reattaches every open view
//! by session id. A caller that would rather tell the user than wait can
//! limit the attempts instead (see [`Retry`]). A reattached view starts
//! over from a checkpoint, which is
//! why views are addressed by session instead of by stream: stream ids
//! last only as long as one channel.
//!
//! A link through the relay keeps trying the host's LAN addresses in the
//! background, and moves to the LAN once one answers: a phone paired while
//! away goes direct when it comes home, without waiting for a reconnect. It
//! also tries a direct path through both NATs, signaled over the relay link
//! itself, and moves to that when it opens.
